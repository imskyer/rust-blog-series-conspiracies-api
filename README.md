# Learning Rust - Conspiracies API 

The code in this repository is part of a blog series that I am writing as I learn Rust.  Each Post will have at least two branches, a branch that matches up with the start of a post (except for the first post) and a branch that has the state of the code at the end of that post. As I finish a post the code for that post is merged into master, so if you want the latest and greatest checkout master. Here's an overview of the posts in this series.

I've started a new series, Learning Elm, where I am building out a UI for the API.  If you are interested, here are the links to the Elm Posts
