# Learning Rust - Conspiracies API 

The code in this repository is part of a blog series that I am writing as I learn Rust.  Each Post will have at least two branches, a branch 
that matches up with the start of a post (except for the first post) and a branch that has the state of the code at the end of that post.
As I finish a post the code for that post is merged into master, so if you want the latest and greatest checkout master. Here's an overview 
of the posts in this series.
